\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
While we think of the night sky as static, it is filled with sources of light that vary in brightness on timescales from seconds and minutes to months and years. 

Some of these events are classified as \textit{transients}, and can be the observational consequences of a large variety of astronomical phenomena. For example, the cataclismic event that occurs when a supernova explodes generates a bright signal that fades with time, but does not repeat.

Other events are classified as \textit{variables}, since they can vary their brightness in a periodic (or aperiodic) fashion, and originate from physical process governing high density regions of the Universe such as emission from the active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the hearts of galaxies, or our position in relation to a set of observed objects (e.g. eclipsing binaries).

These relatively rapid changing objects can provide important clues about themselves and their environement - as well as the evolution of the universe as a whole (e.g. type Ia supernovae provided the first evidence of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe caused by dark energy). Crucially, the different types of transients and variables, given \textit{different} pieces of information, and therefore, the proper classification of transients is a crucial task in observational astronomy - specially in the light of large data volumes expected for the next generation of astronomical surveys.

The two modes for characterising the light from the objects, are called spectroscopy and photometry.

Spectroscopy is the modern equivalent of using a prism to separate a beam of white light in its composite (e.g. rainbow) colours. It is a high resolution measurement which allows us to identify any emission/absorption features indicative of specific chemical elements present in the object - and are also the main source of information enabling classification. Despite being paramount for the classification task, spectroscopy is an extremely time consuming process - with integration times hanging from 20 minutes to a few hours depending on the telescope and brightness of the source.

Traditionally, classification is completely based on spectroscopic measurements - however, given the volume of data expected from the upcoming large scale sky surveys, this strategy is not sustainable. An alternative approach, based on cheaper/lower resolution measurements must be found. The spectra are described as flux per wavelength interval. 

Different physical processes (and chemical elements) are found at different wavelengths of the spectrum, and so different parts are useful to distinguish between objects.

Photometry is gives the overall information of how bright the source is (how much energy the object is emitting) at a particular moment. It can be described as the low resolution counterpart of spectroscopy - or the integral of all the information stored in the spectra. The resultant photometric magnitudes $m$ are related to the flux in a given (average) wavelength through 
\begin{equation}
F = 10^{-0.4m+11} + noise
\end{equation}

These magnitudes are precisely the integral of the spectrum over the filter bandpasses of the instrument. A sequence of photometric observations made at different moments in time is called a light curve. It holds the information of how the energy of the source evolves with time and can also be used to characterize different types of supernovae (although the distinction between classes is much more discrete than we would hope it to be). As a consequence, for each object we will have a number of light curves in each filter (or band). For LSST, the filters are defined as the SDSS $ugrizy$ filter set. Not all bands have the same noise properties, and therefore the bands will vary in usefulness for different objects. In addition, the bands are sensitive to different physical processes in the same way as the spectrum, and so will be more or less useful to distinguish between objects.

In addition to being more cost effective, it is possible to obtain photometry of objects to greater distances (and volumes) in the universe. For an object of given brightness (luminosity), the flux received on earth decreases with the distance to the object as
\begin{equation}
F = \frac{L}{4\pi d_L^2}
\end{equation}

Hence if the intrinsic luminosity of an object is known, then its flux can be used to determine the distance to the object. This distance is an important tool in classification, since different objects are more likely to be found within or outside of our own galaxy.

When working in magnitudes, we connect the distance to the magnitudes via the distance modulus:

\begin{equation}
\mu = m-M = 5\log d_L + 5\log(\frac{c}{H_0}) + 25,
\end{equation}

where $M$ is the (unknown) intrinsic brightness of the object, $d_L$ is measured in megaparsec (Mpc), $c$ is the speed of light and $H_0 \simeq 70$ km/s/Mpc is the Hubble constant. 

New instruments, like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) - scheduled to begin observations in 2022 - will produce an unprecedented number of light curves. Once these transients are detected, we rely on agreements with other telescopes in order to acquire a small number of spectroscopic observations.



The Road so Far
The photometric classification of supernovae has been studied in the astronomical literature for a long time. This culminated in the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SNPCC) (Kessler et al., 2010), where the participants were invited to classify a simulated dataset designed to mimic the specifications of the Dark Energy Survey.

The challenge provided a state of the art description of the classification methods available in the literature, bringing together different groups who had been investigating the problem for a while. Although none of the algorithms performed obviously better than all others, its main legacy was the updated data set and corresponding labels which were made public to the community.

\section{The data}
\label{sec:thedata}
The lightcurve data is made of non-homogeneously sampled, non-periodic time series with correlated errors obtained in several wavelength filters.
