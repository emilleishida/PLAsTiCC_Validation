==========================

About
-----

This is an astronomy "starter kit" for the Photometric LSST Astronomical
Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) being hosted on Kaggle. It's
intended to provide a gentle introduction to some of the astrophysical jargon
and domain knowledge needed to understand the data provided in the challenge.

The starter kit consists of two Project Jupyter notebooks

- ``plasticc_astro_starter_kit.ipynb`` : the astrophysics introduction - can be viewed as a slideshow
- ``plasticc_classification_demo.ipynb`` : an example of building a classifier for the data

Other files:

- ``data/`` : Example data included with the notebooks
- ``media/`` : Images and videos included with the notebooks
- ``README.rst`` : This file
- ``conda_env_py36_osx64.yml`` : a YAML specification to install a compatible environment with conda on OSX
- ``conda_env_py36_i686.yml`` : a YAML specification to install a compatible environment with conda on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 16.04)
- ``requirements.txt`` : file with package specifications for pip

If you have questions about the data or the material in the notebook, find us on the Kaggle forums

Good luck!
