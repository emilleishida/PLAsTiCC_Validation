cadence_analysis - cadence analysis on 20180221 data release. 
    Showed difference in cadence between Galactic and Extragalactic transients.
    This is a "feature" - there are three observing seasons in the data with
    ~90 day gaps. The extra galactic models are only output for the observing
    season they are active, while the galactic models are output for all
    seasons. This also affected the PEAK_MJD distribution, and any time-scale
    based features. Also known to be artifact in 20180316 release (not shown
    since essentially identical)

feature_KDEs - ridgeline plots of initial feature computations from 20180316
    release. Only some features included at present since many need to be 
    reimplemented to work with fluxes. Computed for DDF. In progress for WFD.

features_vs_redshift - 2D KDEs of feature vs redshift to understand evolution.
    similar to above.

TODO:
    - implement more features for flux space
    - bulk load LCs from PHOT.FITS files
    - compute features for IDEAL dataset (from Rick)
    - set bandwidth for KDEs from IDEAL  (from Tina)
    - compute features on PHOTFLAG=4096 separate from al (GN)
    - build a first pass SN classifier (DM)
        - compare against SNmachine (GN)
    - use isolation forest to identify outliers (GN)
    - plot outliers (GN/DM)

Stubbs/Rothschild OpSim files to Rick for alternative cadence sim.
