## Notes on GNDM analysis from GN, DM

cadence_analysis - cadence analysis on 20180221 data release. 
    Showed difference in cadence between Galactic and Extragalactic transients.
    This is a "feature" - there are three observing seasons in the data with
    ~90 day gaps. The extra galactic models are only output for the observing
    season they are active, while the galactic models are output for all
    seasons. This also affected the PEAK_MJD distribution, and any time-scale
    based features. Also known to be artifact in 20180316 release (not shown
    since essentially identical)

feature_KDEs - ridgeline plots of initial feature computations from 20180316
    release. Only some features included at present since many need to be 
    reimplemented to work with fluxes. Computed for DDF. In progress for WFD.

features_vs_redshift - 2D KDEs of feature vs redshift to understand evolution.
    similar to above.

flux_distrib - normalized flux difference = (F_obs - F-sim)/noise
    summary_plots/ - If the noise properties are right, this should have mean =
    0 and sigma = 1
    This was not the case for 20180221 because template flux was not accounted
    for in noise calculation.
    This is fixed in 20180316 
    noise_vs_flux/ - model by model breakdown of noise vs flux
        There are some sharp delta function like features
        These are the result of only a limited number of OpSim files being
        available for the simulation, so a large number of objects all have the
        same noise properties, even if they are bad.
        This clustering is artificial - real surveys shouldn't show this.
        Exarcerbated because most pipelines would fail on really big outliers.
        Rick will add some estimate of SNR at mag=20 to help filter bad
        observations.

TODO:
    - implement more features for flux space
    - bulk load LCs from PHOT.FITS files
    - compute features for IDEAL dataset (from Rick)
    - set bandwidth for KDEs from IDEAL  (from Tina)
    - compute features on PHOTFLAG=4096 separate from al (GN)
    - build a first pass SN classifier (DM)
        - compare against SNmachine (GN)
    - use isolation forest to identify outliers (GN)
    - plot outliers (GN/DM)

Stubbs/Rothschild OpSim files to Rick for alternative cadence sim.
